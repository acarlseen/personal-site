                     California's Bay Area. I've spent the last 20 years in hospitality/culinary
                    roles&mdash; from pizza shops to <i>Chef's Table</i> worthy kitchens.

                    Working in hospitality has provided great opportunities for me to learn valuable skills useful in any
                    environment. The career involves daily long hours full of activity. Environments are stressful, and
                    and communication is key for making plans around resources and solving problems
                    as as team.

                    Hobbies:<br>
                    Obviously, I love cooking and dining out. I also enjoy playing some video games or
                    spending time outdoors when the days are nice. Cycling up into the hills keeps me
                    in good health!

                    Changing careers into another problem solving, production oriented field. I look
                    forward to a better work/life balance, and being able to spend more time with friends
                    and family in the future.
